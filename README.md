# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains the projects developed in the Algorithms and Data Structures course taught by DCA at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.

The course covers fundamental algorithms and data structures, and provides practical experience in implementing them through a series of programming projects. Each week focuses on a different topic, ranging from basic data structures to more advanced algorithms.

In this repository, you can find the code for each week's project, along with any additional resources or notes that may be helpful. Use the links below to navigate to the project for each week:
